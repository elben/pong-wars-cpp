        Special 1 can only be used once per round and are recharged when you
        score on your opponent. Everytime someone scores, a new round
        begins.

   Adrenaline Mode - In Adrenaline Mode, the player that makes the first
        goal gains 2 points, while the defender loses 1 point.

        Adrenaline Mode is activated once a player earns enough points.
        After activation, the player may activate Adrenaline Mode at any
        time.
